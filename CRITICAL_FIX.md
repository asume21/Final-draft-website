# CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT FIX

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
Vite is in devDependencies but Render production builds don't install devDependencies.

## SOLUTION
Moved Vite and build tools to dependencies:
- vite
- esbuild  
- @vitejs/plugin-react

## RESULT
Now Vite will be available during Render's production build process.

## BUILD COMMAND (UNCHANGED)
```
chmod +x simple-build.sh && ./simple-build.sh
```

This fixes the "Cannot find package 'vite'" error permanently.
